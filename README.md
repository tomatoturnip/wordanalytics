Launch Academy Systems Check-in (Week 4)

Assignment:

Given a long string or set of paragraphs, perform some analysis that provides the following:

1. Number of each word
2. Number of each letter
3. Number of each symbol (any non-letter and non-digit character, excluding white space)
4. Top three most common words
5. Top three most common letters

6. Noncore: Number of words only used once
7. Noncore: All letters not used in the string

Use TDD to drive the design of a WordAnalysis class. There should be an instance method defined for each of the bullets listed above.

Do the work of identifying the desired data structure required to implement each method. Use tests to guide the design and construction of those data structures.
